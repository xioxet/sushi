#sushi

practice machine for CSAD, modelled quite similarly to the machine i got in my test. made for my friends but you can use it too

build:

    sudo docker build . -t cane:sushi

run:

    sudo docker run --rm cane:sushi

 flag format: 
 
	CANE{...}

if you can do this you should be able to do the test. there are 8 flags, and it builds to around 3GB. good luck
